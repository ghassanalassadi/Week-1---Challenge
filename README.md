<h1>Week 1 Challenge</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The motivation for this project involves the refactoring of sample HTML and CSS code in order to make the code more semantic and the website more accessible. I built this project as a challenge provided by my coding bootcamp. It serves to teach about accessibility, semantic HTML and their importance in web development. It was also intended to be an introduction to refactoring code. This project solves the problem a hypothetical client has about the accessibility of their website and to improve their code and its readability.
